    description: "My favorite book is War and Peace. And I know what you're thinking: \"Oh, another writer wanting people to think he's all intellectual and highbrow.\" But it really is my favorite book, only not because it has 1,500 pages of unforgettable characters or a generational plot that is more compelling than that of any other book I've read."

description: "Last night, at the premiere of Werner Herzog's documentary on the internet, someone asked Herzog what he would say as advice to young filmmakers. Herzog replied: \"Read, read, read, read, read, read.\" It reminded me of this 1916 quote from Henry Hazlitt, in his Thinking as a Science: \"A man with a scant vocabulary will almost certainly be a weak thinker."
