  As a filmmaker, as a historian, as an American, I have been drawn continually
  to the life and example and words of Abraham Lincoln. He seems to get us
  better than we get ourselves. One hundred and fifty eight years ago, in mid
  June of 1858, Abraham Lincoln, running in what would be a failed bid for the
  United States Senate, at a time of bitter partisanship in our national
  politics, almost entirely over the issue of slavery, spoke to the Republican
  State Convention in the Illinois State House in Springfield. His political
  party, the Republican Party, was brand new, born barely four years before with
  one single purpose in mind: To end the intolerable hypocrisy of chattel
  slavery that still existed in a country promoting certain unalienable rights
  to itself and the world. He said, “A house divided against itself cannot
  stand.” A house divided against itself cannot stand. Four and half years later
  he was president, presiding over a country in the midst of the worst crisis in
  American history, our Civil War—giving his annual message to Congress, what we
  now call the State of the Union. The State of the Union was not good. His
  house was divided. But he also saw the larger picture. The dogmas of the quiet
  past are inadequate to the stormy present. “The occasion is piled high with
  difficulty,” he said, “and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new,
  we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and we then
  will shall save our country.” And then he went on. “Fellow citizens we cannot
  escape history. The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down, in
  honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. The
  world will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union. In
  giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free—honorable alike in
  what we give, and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the
  last best hope of earth.” You are this latest generation he was metaphorically
  speaking about. And you are, whether you are yet aware of it or not, charged
  with saving our union. The stakes are slightly different than the ones Lincoln
  faced. There is not yet armed rebellion, but they are just as high. And before
  you go out and try to live and shape the rest of your life you are required
  now to rise as Lincoln implored us with the occasion. You know it’s terribly
  fashionable these days to criticize the United States government, the
  institution Lincoln was trying to save. To blame it for all of the ills known
  to human kind, and my goodness, ladies and gentlemen, let’s be honest, it has
  made more than its fair share of catastrophic mistakes. But you would be hard
  pressed to find in all of human history, a greater force for good. From our
  Declaration of Independence to our Constitution and Bill of Rights, from
  Lincoln’s emancipation proclamation and the 13th, 14th, 15th and women’s 19th
  amendments to land grant college and homestead acts from the transcontinental
  railroad and our national parks to child labor laws, social security, and the
  national labor relations acts from the GI bill, and the interstate highway
  system, to putting a man on the moon and the affordable care act, the United
  States government has been the author of many of the best aspects of our
  public and personal lives. But if you tune into politics, if you listen to the
  rhetoric of this election cycle you are made painfully aware that everything
  is going to hell in a hand basket and the chief culprit is our evil
  government. Part of the reason this kind of criticism sticks is because we
  live in an age of social media, where we are constantly assured that we are
  all independent free agents. But that free agency is essentially unconnected
  to real community, divorced from civic engagement, duped into believing in our
  own lonely primacy by a sophisticated media culture that requires you, no
  desperately needs you to live in an all-consuming disposable present. Wearing
  the right blue jeans, driving the right car, carrying the right handbag,
  eating at all the right places, blissfully unaware of the historical tides
  that have brought us to this moment, blissfully uninterested in where those
  tides might take us. Our spurious sovereignty is reinforced and perpetually
  underscored to our obvious and great comfort, but this kind of existence
  actually engrains in us a stultifying sameness that rewards conformity not
  courage, ignorance and anti-intellectualism, not critical thinking. This
  wouldn’t be so bad, if we were just wasting our own lives, but this year our
  political future depends on it. And there comes a time when I, and you, can no
  longer remain neutral, silent; we must speak up, and speak out. For 216 years,
  our elections, though bitterly contested, had featured the philosophies and
  characters of candidates who were clearly qualified. That is not the case this
  year. One is glaringly not qualified. So before you do anything with your
  well-earned degree, you must do everything you can to defeat the retrograde
  forces that have invaded our democratic process, divided our house. To fight
  against, no matter your political persuasion, the dictatorial tendencies of
  the candidate with zero experience in the much maligned, but subtle art of
  governance. Who is against lots of things, but doesn’t seem to be for
  anything—offering only bombastic and contradictory promises and terrifying
  Orwellian statesman, a person who easily lies, creating an environment where
  the truth doesn’t seem to matter, who has never demonstrated any interest in
  anyone or anything, but himself and his own enrichment. Who insults veterans,
  threatens the free press, mocks the handicapped, denigrates women, immigrants,
  and all Muslims; a man who took more than a day to remember to disavow a
  supporter who advocates white supremacy and the Ku Klux Klan. An infantile,
  bullying man, who depending on his mood is willing to discard old and
  established alliances, treaties, and long-standing relationships. I feel
  genuine sorrow for the understandably scared and they feel powerless—people
  who have flocked to his campaign in the mistaken belief that as often happens
  on TV, a wand can be waved and every complicated problem can be solved with
  the simplest of solutions. They can’t; it is a political Ponzi scheme. And
  asking this man to assume the highest office in the land would be like asking
  a newly minted car driver to fly a 747. As a student of history, I recognize
  this type. He emerges everywhere and in all eras. We see nurtured in his
  campaign an incipient proto-fascism, a nativist anti-immigrant
  know-nothingism, a disrespect for the judiciary, the prospect of women losing
  authority over their own bodies, African Americans again asked to go to the
  back of the line, voter suppression gleefully promoted, jingoistic saber
  rattling, a total lack of historical awareness, a political paranoia that
  predictably points fingers, always making the other wrong. These are all
  virulent strains that have at times infected us in the past, but they now loom
  in front of us again, all happening at once. We know from our history books
  that these are the diseases of ancient and now fallen empires. We know from
  our history books that these are the diseases of ancient and now fallen
  empires. The sense of commonwealth, of shared sacrifice, of trust—so much a
  part of American life is eroding fast, spurred along and amplified by an
  amoral Internet that permits a lie to circle the globe three times before the
  truth can get started. We longer have the luxury of neutrality or balance or
  even bemused disdain. Many of our media institutions have largely failed to
  expose this charlatan, torn between a nagging responsibility to good
  journalism and the big ratings a media circus always delivers. In fact, they
  have given him the abundant airtime he so desperately craves, so much so that
  it has actually worn down our natural human revulsion to this kind of
  behavior. Hey, he’s rich; he must be doing something right. He’s not. Edward
  R. Murrow would have exposed this naked emperor months ago. He is an insult to
  our history. And do not be deceived by his momentary good behavior; it’s only
  a spoiled misbehaving child hoping somehow to still have dessert. And do not
  think that the tragedy in Orlando underscores his points; it does not. We must
  disenthrall ourselves as Abraham Lincoln said from the culture of violence and
  guns and then we shall save our country. This ladies and gentlemen is not a
  liberal or conservative issue, a red state, blue state divide; this is an
  American issue. Many honorable people, including the last two Republican
  presidents—members of the party of Abraham Lincoln—have declined to support
  him. And I implore those Vichy Republicans who have endorsed him to please,
  please reconsider. We must remain committed to the kindness and community that
  are the hallmarks of civilization and reject the troubling unfiltered
  Tourette’s of his tribalism. The next few months of your commencement, that is
  to say, your future will be critical to the survival of the Republic. The
  occasion is piled high with difficulty. Let us pledge here today that we will
  not let this happen to the exquisite, yet deeply flawed land we all love and
  cherish, and hope to leave intact to our posterity. Let us nobly save, not
  meanly lose, the last best hope of earth. Let me speak directly to the
  graduating class: Watch out, here comes the advice. Look, I am the father of
  four daughters. If someone tells you they’ve been sexually assaulted, take it
  effing seriously and listen to them. Maybe someday we will make the survivor’s
  eloquent statement as important as Dr. King’s letter from a Birmingham jail.
  OK, try not to make the other wrong, as I just did with the presumptive
  nominee: Be for something. Be curious, not cool. Feed your soul too, everyday.
  Remember insecurity makes liars of us all, not just presidential candidates.
  Don’t confuse success with excellence. The poet Robert Penn Warren once told
  me that careerism is death. Do not descend too deeply into specialism either,
  educate all of your parts, you will be healthier. Free yourself from the
  limitations of the binary world; it is just a tool, a means, not an end. Seek
  out and have mentors, listen to them. The late theatrical director Tyrone
  Guthrie once said, “We are looking for ideas large enough to be afraid of
  again.” Embrace those new ideas. Bite off more than you can chew. Travel; do
  not get stuck in one place. Visit our national parks. Their sheer majesty may
  remind you of your own atomic insignificance, as one observer noted. But in
  the inscrutable ways of nature, you will feel larger and spirited, just as the
  egotist in our midst is diminished by his or her self-regard. Insist on
  heroes, and be one. Read: The book is still the greatest man-made machine of
  all—not the car, not the TV, not the smartphone. Make babies. One of the
  greatest things that will happen to you is that you will have to worry—I mean
  really worry—about someone other than yourself. It is liberating and
  exhilarating, I promise. Ask your parents. Do not lose your enthusiasm. In its
  Greek etymology, the word enthusiasm means simply ‘God in us.’ Serve your
  country. Insist that we fight the right wars. Convince your government, as
  Lincoln knew, that the real threat always and still comes from within this
  favored land. Governments always forget that. Insist that we support science
  and the arts, especially the arts; they have nothing to do with the actual
  defense of our country, they just make our country worth defending. Believe.
  Believe as Arthur Miller told me in an interview for my very first film on the
  Brooklyn Bridge. Believe that maybe you to could add something that would last
  and be beautiful. And vote. You indelibly underscore your citizenship and our
  connection to each other when you do. Good luck and Godspeed.
