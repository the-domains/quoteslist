Dark Matter

The show centers around the crew of the Raza, a high tech ship manned by a bunch of misfits. And by misfit I mean group of outlaws, murders, and pirates. The twist, however, is that each member of the crew starts out the series with their memories erased. They hold onto their abilities and personalities, but the details of who they are remain a mystery.

This allows the audience to go on a journey of discovery where each member of the crew must discover his own history, while also dealing with the perils of space and their newfound mercenary-hood.

So far the show reminds me of Firefly. Space mercenaries are always interesting to watch, and the scope of a show like this allows the writers to explore pretty much any theme they'd like.
