            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Simple Plan to Start Reading More</h1><p>I love the physical nature of having books up there on the bookshelves, waiting to be looked at, admired, and remembered.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>15 Things You Should Never Put On Your Resume</h1><p>David Goehring/flickr How many times have you applied for a job and never heard back? You tell yourself, "They probably never saw it," or, "Maybe I just wasn't a good fit," and you move on. But, more likely, your resume just didn't impress. Hiring managers receive dozens - sometimes hundreds - of resumes for any given opening.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c80a6f9fc40642f6958e1a6df0f3111713af0ae5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
